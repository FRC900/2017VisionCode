	<!-- 
		Transform: x y z roll pitch yaw 
		Need 1 transform for each sensor source mapping
		from the base_link (fixed known point on the
		robot, for example, the center) to the location
		of each sensor
	-->

  <!-- 
	    link position of camera on robot to base_link 
		Need two of these, both with same x,y,z r,p,y offset
		First one links the odom fixed starting point to 
		the fixed starting point of the camera's initial frame. Typically
		the fixed odom frame is where the base_link of the robot
		is when it starts up, so an offset is needed to account for
		where the camera is relative to the base link.
		The current camera frame is where the camera is now. Since 
		it is fixed to the robot, it is the same static distance away
		from base_link at all times.  
		The cameral frame is defined to be the center of the left
        camera lens.  There is a urdf file which defines the center
        of the camera (which is also the depth frame) as well as the
        right camera frame.
