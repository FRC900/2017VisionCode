This example obtains depth images using the OpenNI API.  It's designed to work
with either a Microsoft Kinect, or PrimeSense sensor, although I haven't
actually tested it on a PrimeSense.

You must have OpenNI installed, and either the Kinect or PrimeSense.

Kinect modules:
  As of Apr 21, 2011, there's no "official" repository of Kinect modules for
  OpenNI, but there are community-developed forks of the PrimeSense module.  One
  promising such fork is here:
