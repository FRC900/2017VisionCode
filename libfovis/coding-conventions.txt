libfovis guidelines
===================

libfovis should never have an external dependency that is not Eigen3.

Public data structures that are part of the external API should never use or
require EIGEN_MAKE_ALIGNED_OPERATOR_NEW.  Data structures internal to libfovis
may use EIGEN_MAKE_ALIGNED_OPERATOR_NEW.
